# SMAC

The SMAC stands for Spatial Multi-category Angle-based Classifier. For more detailed information about the modeling and method, please refer to the original paper "SMAC: Spatial Multi-category Angle-based Classifer for High-dimensional Neuroimaging Data".

The SMAC is designed for the efficient identification of such imaging biomarkers. It only utilizes the spatial structure of high-dimensional imaging data, but also handles both binary and multi-category classification problems. Also, it can deal with the spatial penalized regression problems.

For more information about how to use this package, please refer to the manual file "SMAC Manual_v1.0.pdf".
